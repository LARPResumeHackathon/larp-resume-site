* Ruby version
  Ruby 2.4.0p, Rails 5.0.1

* Setup
  run `rake setup`
  This will drop the current database, so no active rails sessions can be using the database

* Issue and Waffle Integration
  We are using WaffleBot! It's pretty cool
  To use it, when you create a branch for an issue, name the branch like this:
  `[issue-number]-name-of-branch` for instance: `3-add-rake-setup-task`

* Commit Messages
  When you create a commit message, please make it descriptive and
  somewhere within your commit message, please include `closes #[issue-number]`
  for instance: `closes #3`
